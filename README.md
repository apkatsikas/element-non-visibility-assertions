Asserting for non-visibility can be lead to false positives.

Consider how elements load asynchronously in the modern web. In this repo, `index.html` features an element with text "early", that is loaded immediately, and an element with text "late" that takes just 1/4 of a second to load. To the eye, it seems to load almost instantly, but our test, which expects that is not visibile, passes. Why? Because tools like Playwright are very fast! So, while checking that something that was once visible disappears can be a reliable and meaningful check, testing that something is not visible can be tricky and lead to false positives.
